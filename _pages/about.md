I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Health Care Policy](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu), Harvard Medical School. I draw on methods from causal inference, machine learning and artificial intelligence to inform health policy and clinical practice. My main areas of focus include policy evaluation, healthcare equity, determinants of technology adoption, optimal care allocation rules and shared decision-making across different levels of the healthcare system.

I completed my PhD in Health Policy at the [Institute of Global Health Innovation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/global-health-innovation/), Imperial College London. I hold an MSc in Health Policy, Planning and Financing from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), an MSc in Biomedical Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (University of Lisbon) and a BSc in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Beira Interior.
